Frappe and other contributors of ERPNext reserve the right to modify the applicable licence at any time. Unless prohibited by the applicable licence, any person may acquire, use, modify, transmit and re-distribute ERPNext in accordance with the terms of its applicable licence. Obtaining ERPNext does not provide anyone the right to use any of Frappe's intellectual property rights in a manner that is not explicitly permitted by the applicable licence.

Fees charged under this Agreement, if any, are charged for Services provided under this Agreement. No fee is charged under this Agreement for provision of ERPNext software. ERPNext is provided as-is with no support, unless this Agreement is accepted, an Order Form is executed, and Customer complies with the terms of this Agreement and applicable Order Terms.

Frappe shall provide, and Customer may request and avail, Services under this Agreement for a maximum number of Instances or websites, as specified in the Order Terms.

If the number of Instances or websites is not specified in the Order Form and/or Order Terms, the number of Instances shall be deemed to be limited to 1 Instance.

<br>
<b> 2.5.</b> Service Availability. We will do our utmost to ensure that availability of the Website will be uninterrupted and that transmissions will be error-free.

In order to continue availing such Services that require the use of Consulting Hours, Customer and Frappe must execute an additional Order Form for the provision of additional Consulting Hours, upon payment of an additional fee and on such terms as may be specified in writing. Under-utilization of Consulting Hours during the Term of the Agreement shall not be a valid ground for any partial or complete refund.

In addition to Customer's other rights and Frappe's other obligations hereunder, if any Service becomes, or in Frappe's opinion is likely to become, subject of a claim of infringement, misappropriation, or violation of any intellectual property rights, and in the event of any adjudication that the Service, or any part thereof, does infringe, misappropriate, or violate any intellectual property rights, Frappe must either provide Customer the right to continue to use that Service, or replace or modify the Service so it is no longer infringing and that is qualitatively and functionally at least the equivalent of the affected Service. If neither of the foregoing is commercially and reasonably available to Frappe, Customer shall return all materials relating to the Services to Frappe, or the Service may be deactivated by Frappe, and Frappe must then refund Customer a prorated amount of the fees paid for the infringing Service based on the remaining contracted period. Frappe shall have no obligation or liability hereunder for any claim resulting from: (a) modification of the Services by any party other than Frappe provided that such claim would have not arisen but for such modification; (b) modification of the Services by Frappe in accordance with Customer's designs, specifications, or instructions; (c) use other than as granted in this Agreement provided that such claim would have been avoided but for such use; or (d) use of a superseded version of the Services if the infringement claim could have been avoided by using a current version available to Customer.
<br>

12. Confidentiality
</h3>
<b>12.1 </b>Definition of Confidential Information. "Confidential Information" means all information disclosed by a party ("Disclosing Party") to the other party ("Receiving Party"), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information of Frappe includes the Services, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement, all invoices (including pricing), any software or documentation related to the Services, samples and templates. Confidential Information of each party includes findings, business and marketing plans, trade secrets, technical know-how, technology and technical information, inventions, materials, product development plans and designs, and business processes. However, Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) is or becomes a common knowledge or common practice in the industry, or is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the non-disclosure obligations set forth in this "Confidentiality" section apply to Confidential Information exchanged between the parties in connection with the Services provided under this Agreement.
<br>
<b> 12.2</b> Protection of Confidential Information.As between the parties, each party retains all ownership rights in and to its Confidential Information. The Receiving Party will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care) to (i) not use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement and (ii) except as otherwise authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, limit access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its employees and contractors who need that access for purposes consistent with this Agreement. Neither party will disclose the terms of this Agreement or any invoice to any third party other than its group companies, legal counsels and accountants without the other party's prior written consent, provided that a party that makes any such disclosure to its group companies, legal counsels or accountants will remain responsible for such group company's, legal counsel's or accountant's compliance with this "Confidentiality" section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Frappe may disclose the terms of this Agreement and any applicable invoice to a subcontractor to the extent necessary to perform Frappe's obligations under this Agreement, under terms of confidentiality materially as protective as set forth herein.
<br>
<b> 12.3 </b>Compelled Disclosure. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent compelled by law to do so, including but not limited to obligations under a law, court order, government order or law enforcement provided that the Receiving Party gives: (a) prior notice of the compelled disclosure to the Disclosing Party (to the extent legally permitted); and (b) reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information.
