19. Taking care of your Password (Password security)
nextlinksystems.com firmly believes in protecting the personal information of the customer. nextlinksystems.com or any of its staff or official will never ask for any password or related information from its customers and the customers are also advised, in order to protect access to their accounts and to other channels, do not disclose the passwords to anyone. Generally, when you subscribe to free trial or make a purchase at nextlinksystems.com, you are required to generate your own password. It is recommended that the customers necessarily choose their own passwords carefully such that no unauthorized access is made by a third party. You are also advised not to keep any written or other record of the password/s so that no third party could access the same. You should not disclose the password to anyone. In order that the passwords become complex and difficult for others to guess the you should carefully choose the alpha numeric passwords with combination of upper case alphabets and numbers and special characters (like @, %, &, ! etc.) The password is a private information and must be kept confidential by the owner of the username related to the password. If a password is known by someone other than the owner, that username and password could be misused to access resources and information and possibly with criminal intentâ€”and without notice since they would appear as the registered owner. We will bear no responsibility for loss caused to you in relation to password theft or unauthorized access due to weak passwords etc.
